These steps document how to install Adobe Digital Editions on elementary OS 5.1 Hera.

## Installation

The easiest way to install Adobe Digital Editions is to use `winetricks` - it does all the heavy lifting for you. Please be aware, you also need to install windinb for Adobe Digital Editions to work properly:

```
sudo apt install winbind winetricks
winetricks adobe_diged
```

## Troubleshooting

Make sure you did not tried to install the newer `adobe_diged4`, because this one crashes on elementary OS Hera 5.1.
